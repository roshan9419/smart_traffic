	  * May 29 At least 55 traffic control booths constructed by Guwahati traffic police about 
                     five years ago have almost been abandoned by the cops manning traffic with many of them terming them 
	    	     "uncomfortable." In 2007, traffic police had set up the glass traffic booths at many intersections, while 
                    Incoda, a private company in Calcutta, had provided some traffic booths fitted with fans to give relief to 
                    the cops struggling to manage traffic under sun and rain. Now, all of them have been abandoned.

	* Traffic police personnel said it was not possible to sit in the booths, as they have to constantly stay on the streets to manage traffic. Residents 
 	     blamed lack of foresight and unscientific construction resulting in wastage of public money. “When these booths were set up, we had raised 
	    objection that these are not fit for Guwahati and is nothing but a waste of public money. Today our concern has been proved right. A traffic cop 
	   cannot sit inside the booth as he has to be on the streets as people here are least bothered about traffic norms and they continue to jump 
	   traffic lights. Unless they see traffic cops on the street, people hardly pay any heed to traffic rules,” Satyen Kumar Doloi of Save Guwahati Build 
	   Guwahati, a city-based NGO, said.

	* The traffic booths fitted with fans were put up by Incoda in 2007 on the condition that they would put up advertisements and collect revenue. 
	   But be it at Ulubari, Guwahati Club, Chandmari, Zoo Road or any other traffic intersection, the traffic control booths are lying unused for long. 
	   A sum of Rs 2.5 lakh was spent on the construction of each booth.

	* At the intersection at Ulubari, there is one glass-traffic control booth and an Incoda booth but the traffic cops manning the intersection do not 
	  use them. "We cannot sit inside the glass booth. These are of no use,” a traffic policeman at Ulubari said.

     		 "We have to remain on the street even as automatic traffic lights have been put up here. So if we sit inside the traffic booths, 
		people will not pay any heed to us and we will have to face the wrath of people in case of an accident,” the police said.

	* A senior traffic police officer said these booths are not used as automatic traffic lights have been put up to improve 
	   traffic management system in the city. "These booths were set up when there was no traffic lights and it was difficult for our 
	   traffic cops to stand in the heat and dust. But these are now not used as we have the lights and traffic is managed automatically 
	   from last year,” he said.

	But why is public money spent in this way

	The official said, "These booths were set up before I joined the force.”
